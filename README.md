## 🔍 Overview

This project offers several key tools that are essential when working with ZK proofs and related data formats:

- **Query Proof Selector Parser 🧩**  
  Parse the bitmask that dictates which fields in a ZK proof are revealed versus verified. This tool helps you debug and ensure that privacy settings are correctly applied.

- **Query Proof Public Signals Parser 🔎**  
  Decode and inspect the public signals produced by ZK circuits, facilitating easier integration and verification of proofs.

- **Passport Date Converter 📅**  
  Convert passport date formats to standardized forms, ensuring compatibility with various ZK verification circuits.

- **Number Converter 🔢**  
  Transform numbers between different bases and formats to support cryptographic and proof-related operations.

- **Base64 to Image Converter 🖼️**  
  Convert Base64-encoded strings into images, aiding in the quick visualization and debugging of image data encoded in proofs.
